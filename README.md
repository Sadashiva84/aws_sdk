# Monitoring, Scaling and Automation

1. Web Application Deployment: 

 - Use `boto3` to: 

 - Create an S3 bucket to store your web application's static files. 

 - Launch an EC2 instance and configure it as a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).  - Deploy the web application onto the EC2 instance. 

2. Load Balancing with ELB: 

 - Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) using `boto3`. 

 - Register the EC2 instance(s) with the ALB. 

3. Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Configuration: 

 - Using `boto3`, create an ASG with the deployed EC2 instance as a template. 

 - Configure scaling policies to scale in/out based on metrics like CPU utilization or network traffic. 

4. Lambda-based Health Checks & Management: 

 - Develop a Lambda function to periodically check the health of the web application  (through the ALB). 

 - If the health check fails consistently, the Lambda function should: 

 - Capture a snapshot of the failing instance for debugging purposes.

 - Terminate the problematic instance, allowing the ASG to replace it.  - Send a notification through SNS to the administrators. 

5. S3 Logging & Monitoring: 

 - Configure the ALB to send access logs to the S3 bucket. 

 - Create a Lambda function that triggers when a new log is added to the S3 bucket. This function can analyze the log for suspicious activities (like potential DDoS attacks) or just high traffic. 

 - If any predefined criteria are met during the log analysis, the Lambda function sends a  notification via SNS. 

6. SNS Notifications: 

 - Set up different SNS topics for different alerts (e.g., health issues, scaling events, high traffic). 

 - Integrate SNS with Lambda so that administrators receive SMS or email notifications. 

7. Infrastructure Automation: 

 - Create a single script using `boto3` that: 

 - Deploys the entire infrastructure. 

 - Updates any component as required. 

 - Tears down everything when the application is no longer needed.
